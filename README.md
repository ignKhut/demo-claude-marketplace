# Claude Code Private Marketplace Demo

> A teaching project that shows how to build a private plugin marketplace for Claude Code. Contains two example plugins with agents, commands, and skills -- everything you need to understand the plugin architecture and start building your own.

## What This Demo Shows

If you have been looking at Claude Code plugins and wondering "how do I actually structure a private marketplace for my team?" -- this is your reference. The repository demonstrates:

- How to create a **marketplace manifest** (`marketplace.json`) that lists and distributes plugins
- How to structure **plugins** with agents, commands, and skills
- How plugins, project config (`CLAUDE.md`), and settings work together to form the full Claude Code experience

This is a demo. The plugins here are illustrative -- they show the correct file structure and conventions, not production-ready tooling. Use this as a starting point, then refer to the official docs linked below for the full specification.

## How Plugin Marketplaces Work

A marketplace is a Git repository with a `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json` at its root. This manifest declares the marketplace name, owner, and lists all available plugins with their relative source paths.

Here is the manifest from this demo:

```json
{
  "name": "demo-marketplace",
  "owner": {
    "name": "Demo Author",
    "email": "demo@example.com"
  },
  "plugins": [
    {
      "name": "data-toolkit",
      "source": "./claude-plugins/data-toolkit",
      "description": "Adds data engineering agents, commands, and skills for ETL pipeline development."
    },
    {
      "name": "api-guardian",
      "source": "./claude-plugins/api-guardian",
      "description": "Adds API security auditing agents, commands, and skills for governance and OWASP compliance."
    }
  ]
}
```

Users add the marketplace and install plugins like this:

```shell
# Add this marketplace (from a Git repo URL or local path)
/plugin marketplace add ./path/to/demo-claude-marketplace

# Install a specific plugin
/plugin install data-toolkit@demo-marketplace
```

For private repositories, Claude Code uses your existing git credential helpers. If `git clone` works in your terminal, it works in Claude Code.

## What Plugins Provide

Each plugin is a directory with `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` at its root, plus any combination of these components:

| Component | Location | Purpose |
|-----------|----------|---------|
| **Agents** | `agents/*.md` | Specialized subagents with custom system prompts, tool access, and permissions. Appear in `/agents`. |
| **Commands** | `commands/*.md` | Slash commands invokable with `/plugin-name:command`. |
| **Skills** | `skills/<name>/SKILL.md` | Reusable expertise modules Claude loads automatically based on task context. Can include supporting files. |
| **MCP Servers** | `.mcp.json` | Model Context Protocol server definitions for external tool integrations. |
| **Hooks** | `hooks/hooks.json` | Event handlers that fire on lifecycle events (PostToolUse, PreToolUse, etc.). |
| **LSP Servers** | `.lsp.json` | Language Server Protocol configs for code intelligence. |

> **Note:** MCP server definitions should live within plugins (via `.mcp.json` or inline in `plugin.json`) when the capability is meant to be reusable across projects. This keeps the MCP configuration bundled with the plugin and distributed through the marketplace automatically.

## Included Plugins

### data-toolkit

Data engineering capabilities for ETL pipeline development and analytics workflows.

- **Agents:** `data-engineer` and `pipeline-architect` -- specialized subagents for data infrastructure tasks
- **Commands:** `/data-toolkit:ingest` and `/data-toolkit:transform` -- slash commands for data operations
- **Skills:** `sql/` and `etl/` -- domain expertise Claude applies automatically when working on data tasks

### api-guardian

API security and governance tooling for auditing, validation, and standards enforcement.

- **Agents:** `security-auditor` and `api-reviewer` -- subagents for security analysis and API design review
- **Commands:** `/api-guardian:audit` and `/api-guardian:scan` -- slash commands for security operations
- **Skills:** `openapi/` and `security/` -- domain expertise for OpenAPI validation and OWASP compliance

## Plugins vs. Project Configuration

Claude Code has two layers that work together. Understanding which concerns belong where is key to a clean setup.

### Plugins handle reusable capabilities

Plugins package agents, commands, skills, MCP servers, and hooks that are **shared across projects and teams**. They are versioned, distributed through marketplaces, and namespaced to avoid conflicts. Use plugins when the functionality is not specific to a single codebase.

### Project config handles domain context

Project-level configuration handles concerns **specific to this codebase**:

- **`CLAUDE.md`** -- project memory: architecture decisions, coding conventions, team guidelines. Claude loads this at the start of every session.
- **`.claude/settings.json`** -- permission rules, environment variables, hooks scoped to this project. This file is committed to git and shared with the team.
- **`.claude/settings.local.json`** -- personal overrides that stay on your machine (gitignored).
- **Hooks** -- lifecycle automation (format on save, block protected files, notifications) that enforces project-specific rules.

The split is straightforward: plugins are for reusable capabilities you distribute, project config is for the domain context and conventions that make this specific codebase work. A plugin might provide a `security-auditor` agent, while your `CLAUDE.md` explains your project's specific authentication architecture so that agent has the right context.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Claude Code version 1.0.33 or later (`claude --version`)
- Git access to this repository (or a local clone)

### Test locally

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone <repo-url> demo-claude-marketplace
cd demo-claude-marketplace

# Launch Claude Code with the marketplace loaded locally
claude --plugin-dir ./claude-plugins/data-toolkit --plugin-dir ./claude-plugins/api-guardian
```

### Use as a marketplace

```bash
# Add this repo as a marketplace source
# (within Claude Code)
/plugin marketplace add ./demo-claude-marketplace

# Install a plugin
/plugin install data-toolkit@demo-marketplace

# Validate the marketplace structure
claude plugin validate .
```

### Build your own

1. Create your plugin directory with `.claude-plugin/plugin.json`
2. Add `agents/`, `commands/`, and `skills/` directories as needed
3. Define MCP servers in `.mcp.json` if your plugin integrates external tools
4. Create a marketplace manifest at `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json` in a parent repository
5. Host on GitHub, GitLab, or any git host -- users add it with `/plugin marketplace add`

> **Tip:** Start with standalone configuration in `.claude/` for quick iteration, then convert to a plugin when you are ready to share. The docs cover the migration process in detail.
