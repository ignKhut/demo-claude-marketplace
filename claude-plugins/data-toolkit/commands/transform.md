description: Create data transformation logic with aggregations, joins, and data quality rules.

# Transform Command

Build data transformation pipelines that reshape, aggregate, and enrich data while maintaining quality.

## Scope

This command creates transformation code that:
- Performs SQL transformations (aggregations, joins, window functions)
- Applies business logic and calculations
- Enriches data from multiple sources
- Validates transformed data quality
- Handles edge cases and nulls appropriately
- Optimizes for query performance

## Execution Flow

1. Understand source data and target requirements
2. Design transformation logic with clear stages
3. Write SQL or transformation code with optimization
4. Add data quality validations
5. Implement error handling for edge cases
6. Test with diverse data samples
7. Benchmark performance with realistic volumes
8. Document transformation logic and assumptions

## Constraints

- Use data-toolkit skills for implementation
- Keep transformations composable and testable
- Optimize for both correctness and performance
- Add comments explaining business logic
- Handle nulls and missing data explicitly
- Validate outputs match expected schema
- Test with edge cases and boundary conditions
- Consider incremental vs full refresh tradeoffs
